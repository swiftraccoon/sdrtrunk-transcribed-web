-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview

This web application is designed to serve transcriptions of audio files. It's built using Node.js with the Express framework and utilizes various other libraries and utilities. The application allows users to filter transcriptions based on different criteria like Radio IDs and Talkgroup IDs. It also provides an option to select different themes and auto-refresh intervals.
Features

    Basic Authentication: The application is secured with basic HTTP authentication.
    File Filtering: Users can filter audio files based on Radio IDs, Talkgroup IDs, and date ranges.
    Transcriptions: Alongside each audio file, a corresponding transcription is displayed, which is generated by an AI system.
    Theming: Users can select from different themes to customize the appearance of the application.
    Auto-Refresh: The application can auto-refresh at a user-defined interval.
    Robots Exclusion: A robots.txt file is served to prevent web crawlers from indexing the application.

Dependencies

    express: Web framework for Node.js
    fs: Node.js built-in file system module
    moment-timezone: For date and time manipulation
    path: Node.js built-in path module
    express-basic-auth: For basic HTTP authentication
    cookie-parser: Middleware for parsing cookies
    utility: Custom utility functions for the application

How It Works
Initialization

The application initializes an Express app and sets up middleware for basic authentication and cookie parsing. It also serves static files from a public directory.
Routing

    GET /robots.txt: Serves a robots.txt file to prevent web crawlers from indexing the site.
    GET /: The main route that handles the logic for filtering and sorting audio files and their transcriptions.

Utility Functions

    filterAndSortAudioFiles: Filters and sorts audio files based on user-selected criteria.
    getQueryParams: Extracts query parameters from the request object.
    getDefaultDateTime: Gets the default date and time for filtering.
    processDirectory: Processes a directory to get a list of audio files and their transcriptions.

HTML Rendering

The renderHTML function dynamically generates the HTML content based on the filtered and sorted list of transcriptions.
Security Measures

    Basic HTTP authentication is implemented using the express-basic-auth library.
    Unauthorized access results in a 401 Unauthorized response, and the details are logged.

Installation and Running

    Clone the repository.
    Run npm install to install dependencies.
    Start the server using node index.js (assuming the main file is index.js).
    Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
